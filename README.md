Steps for Creating the app:

####Functionality
- Need to create a front end where a user is selectable
- this fuction will then open the view for all messages

####Technical
- database needs to have identifiers for date, time and user,
- database can be json
- selection of user will just pull up the chronological order of messages
- front end will be ejs 
- two lists will be needed on the fron end, one for users one for creating a view of the conversations
-jquery can be used for the action in selecting the users and conversations
